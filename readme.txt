The tf_flowers dataset is of 218MB, gives us a FeaturesDict object and doesn’t have any splits. Since tf_flowers doesn’t define any standard splits, we use the subsplit feature to divide it into train, validation, and test with 80%, 10%, 10% of the data respectively. We use tfds.load() function to download the dataset. Specifying as_supervised=True downloads the dataset having a 2-tuple structure (input, label) instead of FeaturesDict. Passing with_info=True to tfds.load(), gives us the metadata of the downloaded dataset.
